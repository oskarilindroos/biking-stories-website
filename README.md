# Introduction
This project was done for a 2022 summer MERN stack course. The project's goal was to create a MERN stack application for a biking stories site. On the site users can post their biking related stories and delete or update their own stories. Emphasis was on the site's functionality and not so much on visuals which is why it looks very "bootstrappy".

**The site is deployed live on Render: https://biking-stories-frontend.onrender.com/**

# Technologies used
Client
* React
* React Router
* Axios (for making api calls)
* React Bootstrap (for website layout)

Server
* Node
* Express
* MongoDB Atlas (cloud database for users and stories)
* Mongoose (connection between Node and MongoDB)
* JWT (authentication)
* Bcrypt (encrypting passwords)

# Things that could be improved/added
* Sign up and login form input validation is not the best on the client side
* Token auto refresh
* User profile images are currently just urls. Could add functionality for users to upload their own images with drag and drop.
* Overall quality improvement of the visuals
* Responsiveness
